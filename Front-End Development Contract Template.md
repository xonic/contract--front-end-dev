## Summary

I’ll always do my best to fulfil your needs and meet your expectations, but it’s important to have things written down so that we both know what’s what, who should do what and when, and what will happen if something goes wrong. In this contract you won’t find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. I’ve no desire to trick you into signing something that you might later regret. What I do want is what’s best for both parties, now and in the future.

So in short;

You ([customer name]), located at [customer address] are hiring me (Thomas Nägele) located at [my address] to develop a web site for a [fixed/hourly/monthly] rate of [total] as outlined in our previous correspondence. Of course it’s a little more complicated, but we’ll get to that.

## What do both parties agree to do?

*You:* You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company or your organisation. You’ll give me everything I need to complete the project as and when and in the format I need it. You’ll review our work, provide feedback and approval in a timely manner too. Deadlines work two ways, so you’ll also be bound by dates we set together. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out at the end of this contract.

*I:* I have the experience and ability to do everything I’ve agreed with you and I’ll do it all in a professional and timely manner. I’ll endeavour to meet every deadline that’s set and on top of that I'll maintain the confidentiality of everything you give me.

## Deliverables

### HTML, CSS/Sass and JavaScript

I deliver web page types developed from HTML5 markup, CSS2.1 + 3 (powered by Sass) stylesheets for styling and unobtrusive JavaScript for feature detection, poly-fills and behaviours. I do not deliver any server-side code or features but I will coordinate my work with your back-end developer to ensure that your front- and back-end function well together.

## Contents

### Text content

I’m not responsible for writing or inputting any text copy.

### Photographs

You should supply graphic files in an editable, vector digital format. You should supply photographs in a high resolution digital format. If you choose to buy stock photographs, I can suggest stock libraries. If you’d like me to search for photographs for you, I can provide a separate estimate for that.

## Testing

### Browser testing

Browser testing no longer means attempting to make a website look the same in browsers of different capabilities or on devices with different size screens. It does mean ensuring that a person’s experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of a browser or device.

### Desktop browser testing

I test my work in current versions of major desktop browsers including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome) and Mozilla Firefox. If you need an enhanced design for an older browser, I can provide a separate estimate for that.

### Mobile browser testing

Testing popular small-screen devices is essential in ensuring that a person’s experience of a design is appropriate to the capabilities of the device they’re using. I currently test my work only in:

iOS: Safari

I currently don’t test Google Android, Blackberry, Opera Mini/Mobile, Windows Phone or other mobile browsers. If you need me to test using these, we will need to find a way of getting the necessary devices.

## Technical support

I'm not a website hosting company so I don’t offer support for website hosting, email or other services relating to hosting. You may already have professional hosting and you might even manage that hosting in-house; if you do, great. If you don’t, I can set up an account for you at one of my preferred hosting providers. I can set up your site on a server, plus any statistics software such as Google Analytics and I can provide a separate estimate for that. Then, the updates to, and management of that server will be up to you.

## Legal stuff

I can’t guarantee that my work will be error-free and so I can’t be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you’ve advised me of them. Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

## Copyrights

First, you guarantee that all elements of text, images or other artwork you provide are either owned by your good selves, or that you’ve permission to use them.

Then, when your final payment has cleared, copyright will be automatically assigned as follows:

You’ll own the code that I write for this project. I give you source files and finished files and you should keep them somewhere safe as I'm not required to keep a copy. You own all elements of text, images and data you provided, unless someone else owns them.

I love to show off my work and share what I’ve learned with other people, so I reserve the right, with your permission, to display and link to your project as part of my portfolio and to write about it on websites, in magazine articles and in books.

## Payments

I'm sure you understand how important it is as a freelancer that you pay the invoices that we send you promptly. As I'm also sure you’ll want to stay friends, you agree to stick tight to the following payment schedule.

[Payment schedule]

## Small print

Just like a parking ticket, you can’t transfer this contract to anyone else without my permission. This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place.

Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of German courts.
